## What is this

`dsh-clean-desktop-shell` is a **DSH-plugin-shaped clean desktop shell**: it wraps an already-running DSH Web (default `http://127.0.0.1:3080`) in a native desktop window — system tray, single instance, so it behaves like any normal desktop app. **No visual changes at all**: no frosted glass, no skinning — purely a window shell.

Key differences from other desktop clients in the ecosystem:

| | Other desktop clients (e.g. dsh-desktop family) | This plugin |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Form** | Standalone Electron app with its own profile | **DSH plugin** mounted into your existing profile |
| **Profile** | New `desktop` profile, plugins/config must be reinstalled | **Reuses your web profile**, zero migration |
| **Visual changes** | Custom title bar / frosted glass etc. | **None** — pure window shell |
| **Upstream** | Pinned version | **Tracks 0.1.1-rc.2** |

## Highlights

**① One-click launch — like double-clicking a normal desktop app**

No terminal, no commands. **Double-click the desktop shortcut and the DSH window opens instantly**, just like launching any normal app:

- The installer creates the desktop shortcut automatically; the plugin form asks on first run, plus a one-click "create desktop shortcut" in the tray
- Shows immediately on double-click — never waits for the backend
- Single instance: a second double-click just focuses the existing window

**② Live backend monitoring · quick manual start/stop**

The tray **shows the backend state in real time** (running / starting / stopped / error) with one-click controls:

- **Live monitoring**: the window keeps probing the backend; the moment it is killed, crashes or is stopped, the window flips to the offline screen — a stale page never fakes "still alive"
- **Auto-reconnect**: the instant the backend recovers, the window reloads the real page by itself
- **Quick start/stop**: one-click start / restart / stop from the tray (with progress dialogs); "stop backend" really shuts the service down on 3080, including externally started instances

## Usage

1. If the plugin is installed, launching `dsh` from the command line pops up the desktop window automatically; you can also double-click the desktop shortcut created by the plugin — on par with a native desktop app.
2. Everything from the original web UI works as-is.
3. Detailed settings live in the tray right-click menu. The main window adds no controls of its own, keeping the page clean.

**All backend controls live in the tray** — the main window stays a pure shell:

- Start / restart / stop the backend (with progress dialogs; stopping really shuts down the service on 3080, including externally started instances)
- Auto-detect backend · set the backend install folder (auto-detect default)
- Reload window · create desktop shortcut · check for updates · repo homepage

**Window reliability (Edge-style instant refresh):**

- Shows immediately on launch, never waits for the backend
- While the backend is down, a local "backend offline" screen is shown and re-probed; the real page loads automatically the moment it answers
- The instant the backend stops (tray stop, kill or crash) the window flips back to the offline screen — a stale page never fakes "still alive"
- The offline screen has self-service buttons: reload / start backend / auto-detect backend / set backend install folder

## macOS status (v0.1.7 important note)

v0.1.7 fixes the plugin-mode bug where the shell could not locate `Electron.app`
on macOS, which caused the window to fail silently on Mac.

However, **the maintainer does not currently have a Mac** to verify the
following in person:

- **The .dmg is unsigned and un-notarized**: Apple requires a yearly Developer
  Program membership ($99/yr) for code signing + notarization. The first time you
  open the app from the .dmg, Gatekeeper will likely say the app is "damaged"
  or "cannot be verified".
  - Workaround: run `xattr -cr "/Applications/DSH Clean Desktop Shell.app"`,
    then right-click the app and choose Open.
  - Long-term fix: a Mac co-maintainer with an Apple Developer account can help
    set up signed + notarized builds.
- Post-extract executable bits and quarantine extended attributes can only be
  confirmed on real hardware.
- **If the window still does not appear**: a failed launch writes diagnostics
  to `desktop-shell-launch.log` inside your DSH home:

  ```sh
  cat "${DSH_HOME:-$HOME/.dsh}/desktop-shell-launch.log"
  ```

  Paste the contents into an issue — it records platform, arch, Node version,
  DSH home, runtime directory and the exact error. With no window on screen,
  this is the only thing that can tell us what went wrong.

If you have a Mac and want to co-maintain macOS support (test the .dmg, set up
signing, or add a launch-at-login tray item), PRs and verified issues are very
welcome. You will be added to [CONTRIBUTORS.md](./CONTRIBUTORS.md).

## Security & permissions: what it actually does

Third-party scanners (e.g. [dsh-xray](https://github.com/unStone/dsh-xray)) rate
this project as "high capability combined with sensitive behavior". **That rating
is not a false positive** — every item is real, and every item has a concrete,
necessary reason. You should know what runs on your machine.

| Behavior | Why it is required | Where |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Spawning system commands | The shell's core job is **starting / restarting / stopping the `dsh web` backend** and probing port 3080. There is no way to do that without system commands. | `electron/service.js` |
| Downloading the ~100MB Electron runtime | Needed on first launch. Two sources race with a 3s timeout: `github.com` and `npmmirror.com` — the latter is a CN mirror that is usually much faster on Chinese networks. | `src/host/runtime.js` |
| Calling `api.github.com` | Only for the tray's "Check for updates" action, to read the latest release metadata. | `electron/update.js` |
| Reading env vars | Path resolution and feature switches only: `DSH_HOME` (DSH home), `DSH_SHELL_ELECTRON_DIR` (reuse a local Electron, skip the download), `DSH_SHELL_AUTO_LAUNCH=0` (disable auto-launch), `USERPROFILE` / `APPDATA` (locate `dsh.cmd` and the shortcuts folder on Windows). | `src/host/common.js`, `src/host/index.js`, `electron/shortcut.js` |
| Patching the DSH runtime (`cordis.patch.yml`) | **DSH's official plugin registration mechanism** — every DSH plugin mounts this way, it is not specific to this project. | `cordis.patch.yml` |

**The line it does not cross**: no telemetry, no uploads, no reading of your
conversation data. The network requests above are the only two kinds that exist,
and both can be avoided entirely by setting `DSH_SHELL_ELECTRON_DIR`.

The unsigned-installer warnings (Windows SmartScreen, macOS Gatekeeper) come from
the **absence of a code-signing certificate**, not from any of the above.

## Install

**Option 1: download the installer from Releases (for a standalone desktop app)**

- Windows: `DSH-Clean-Desktop-Shell-Setup-<version>.exe`
- macOS: `DSH-Clean-Desktop-Shell-<version>.dmg` (Intel) or `-arm64.dmg` (Apple Silicon)

The installer **creates a desktop shortcut automatically** and provides the full desktop experience (tray).

- **Windows**: the first time you run the installer you may see a SmartScreen
  warning — **this is normal for unsigned programs, not a virus**, see
  "Windows SmartScreen warning" below.
- **macOS**: the .dmg is unsigned / un-notarized and may trigger Gatekeeper.
  See "macOS status" above.

**Option 2: install as a DSH plugin (DSH ecosystem users)**

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-clean-desktop-shell
```

Restart `dsh web` and the desktop shell window **opens automatically** (the first run prepares the Electron runtime over the network, ~1-2 minutes).

> Option 2 gives you a shell that launches alongside DSH: the window is spawned by the plugin when `dsh web` starts, with **no standalone installer / desktop icon**. For a double-clickable app with a desktop shortcut and auto-update, use Option 1. The core window experience is identical either way.

> The shell needs a reachable `dsh web` service (local or configured remote address). See Usage.

### Windows SmartScreen warning

**Why does the warning appear?**

Our installer has **no code signing certificate** (a personal open-source project — certificates cost a few hundred USD per year). Microsoft Defender SmartScreen is a **reputation system**: it decides whether a program is trusted based on download volume plus a history of clean executions. For a rarely-downloaded, unsigned `.exe` it cannot confirm reputation, so it warns. **This does not mean the file is a virus**: the project is fully open source and the binaries are built by GitHub Actions from this repository (see `.github/workflows/build.yml`).

**When Edge downloads the file:**

It may be flagged as "not commonly downloaded". To keep it:

1. Hover the download entry and click the `...` menu on the right
2. Choose **Keep**
3. Confirm with **Keep anyway**

**When you double-click the installer:**

A blue dialog appears: "Windows protected your PC" — Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting.

1. Click **More info**
2. Verify the file name is `DSH-Clean-Desktop-Shell-Setup-<version>.exe`
3. Click **Run anyway**

**Alternative: unblock the file once (recommended)**

Right-click the installer → Properties → General → tick **Unblock** at the bottom → OK. No more warnings afterwards.

Or bulk-unblock via PowerShell:

```powershell
Unblock-File -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\DSH-Clean-Desktop-Shell-Setup-*.exe"
```

> A code signing certificate (EV or Azure Trusted Signing) would remove this warning entirely, but it costs money and is rarely worth it for individual open-source maintainers. We may adopt signing when the project allows.

```

- **Shell / core separation**: the shell handles only the window, tray and backend management; sessions, agents, plugins and memory all live in the core, decoupled from the UI.
- **Default**: loads the local `127.0.0.1:3080` (your configured web profile, zero migration).
- **Remote-capable**: configure any remote DSH address; the shell is just a window. Phones / Linux / other devices can reach the core via browser or PWA — the shell is never bound to a local service.
- **One shell codebase, two distribution forms**: the installer (standalone exe) and the plugin (launches with `dsh web`) share the same `electron/` code — only the runtime source and launch differ (see Install).

## Changelog

### 0.3.4
- **Main-window flicker fixed (watchdog debounce)**: the window probed the backend every 4 s and a **single 1.5 s miss** was read as "backend dead" — it swapped a perfectly live page for the offline screen, then fully reloaded on recovery, losing the composer draft, scroll position and the streaming reply. Measured root cause: when an IDE / Gradle build pins the machine, the DSH backend's event loop stalls for 5-8 s (in one captured episode even our own 1 Hz sampler skipped 46 s) while the task keeps running. The probe now keeps the failure reason (new `electron/probe.js`: `probeDetail()` returns `{alive,fatal,why}`; `probe()` keeps the old boolean contract): a refused connection still flips **immediately** (tray stop / external kill / crash stay instant), while timeouts, resets and 5xx count as "alive but late" and need 3 misses in a row (~12 s without any answer) to flip; one answer resets the counter. `showOffline()` is now idempotent, so a second trigger no longer re-navigates and flashes again.
- **Attributable logging**: `shell-crash.log` (`%APPDATA%/DSH Clean Desktop Shell/`) now records main-process events — `watchdog: probe miss 1/3 (TIMEOUT)`, `watchdog: offline after 3 miss(es) (...)`, `window: -> offline screen (...)`, `window: offline -> reloading backend page (...)`. Flips used to be silent, so "it blinked" could not be attributed to either side.
- **Unit tests**: new `electron/probe.test.js` (4 cases) pins the boundary — 401 is alive, 502 is a miss but not a death, never answering is a miss but not a death, nothing listening is a death; full `node --test` and the syntax check pass.

### 0.3.3
- **Caption safe area now solved at the root (DSH 0.1.5)**: the 0.2.1 "invisible 148px spacer cell" hooked into a DSH-private slot (`conversation.session.header.utilities`) that the 0.1.5 panel rework removed, and it only dodged the horizontal collision — the header row still sat inside the Windows title-bar drag band. The shell's preload now injects a `padding-top` of caption height onto the page `<body>` (height from Electron's own `env(titlebar-area-height)`, 32px fallback): the whole app (sidebar / header / conversation / rightbar) starts below the title bar, and the native buttons + drag strip float over the reserved empty band instead of page content. The client-half slot registration is gone.
- Verified locally: `npm run build` + syntax check + runtime selftest all pass.

### 0.3.2
- **Approval hover card**: hovering a "needs approval" row in the task bubble pops a matching-style detail card on the bubble’s outer side — requesting tool, approval reason, waited-so-long and queue depth, with three actions: **Reject**, **Details**, **Allow once** (the big bottom-right button). Allow/Reject answer the live approval inside the DSH window through the official PendingApproval.answer channel — exactly equivalent to clicking the in-app card, which dismisses itself in sync; no need to switch to the DSH window first. Clicking **Details** (or anywhere on the card) raises the DSH window on that session. Multiple queued approvals are released one at a time; the card refreshes to the next automatically. Details ride a new pendingApprovals field in the state file (older shells ignore it).
- **Question hover card**: hovering a "needs answer" row pops a matching pink card to answer in place — a single choice question submits on click; multi-question batches page through (‹ ›) with the submit button lighting up only when every question is answered; multi-select ticks options then confirms; free-text questions get an inline input (Enter or Submit); plan reviews show a 「计划评审」 badge with the plan body. Answers go through the official PendingQuestion.answer channel as one batch — identical to answering in the DSH window. Batches that cannot be answered reliably inline (too many questions/options, oversized text) degrade to a read-only hint plus a jump to the DSH window. Rides a new pendingQuestions field in the state file.
- **No more window flashes**: the progress window reveals only after a 700 ms grace (fleeting tasks no longer pop a window), and foreign child windows are hidden synchronously at creation (DshWindow instanceof), before any native frame shows.
- **Orb geometry hardening**: position/area math moved into a dedicated module with end-to-end clamping — corrupt settings fall back to defaults instead of feeding NaN into setPosition (fixes the intermittent setPosition error); slideOrb skips non-finite targets and traces it.
- **Bubble "Clear all"**: a new top-right button (shown only while some finished task still carries an unread dot) marks every finished task read at once (like clicking each row, without jumping); approval / question / running reminders stay untouched. Read marks persist to $DSH_HOME/desktop-shell-read.json — re-observed completions never re-light, while a genuinely new later run still notifies. Row clicks now count as read too.
- **WeChat-style tabbed link window**: target=_blank links no longer open Electron’s stock child window — they all collect into ONE frameless self-drawn window whose bookmark tab strip shares one row with the icon-only toolbar (the strip appears at 2+ links and fills the bar’s middle space): back / forward / reload (spins while loading) / copy link (check feedback) / open in browser / minimize / maximize / close. Draggable, double-click to maximize, no address bar. Each tab is a sandboxed webview on an isolated partition (persist:dsh-shell-links); guest _blank links open as new tabs; closing the last tab closes the window. System schemes (mailto:, tel:, …) go to the OS handler; javascript:/data: are denied.
- **No more File/Edit menu**: the stock application menu is gone entirely on Windows/Linux (macOS keeps its system menu by convention).
- **Unit tests**: zero-dependency node:test suite grown to 83 tests via npm test; installer packaging excludes *.test.js.

### 0.3.1
- **Containerized docking**: the orb window now always stays fully inside one display's work area — the half-hidden look is made by sliding the whale *inside* the container (CSS translate + clipping) instead of hanging the window past the screen edge. Fixes the half-orb leaking onto the neighbouring monitor at inner edges and the bubble opening on the wrong screen (window centers no longer straddle the boundary, so display detection is stable). Hover now covers the whole container — touching anywhere near the edge wakes the orb.
- **Drag DPI fix**: dragging is driven by the main-process cursor (`getCursorScreenPoint`, the same DIP space as `setPosition`) with zero renderer coordinate math — drag now tracks the pointer exactly at 125%/150% scaling and mixed-DPI setups; the context menu is positioned from the cursor too.
- **Cross-monitor dragging**: drag clamping follows the *cursor's* display, so the orb can be dragged onto any monitor and back (previously, once it entered the second screen it could never return).
- **Auto-dock toggle**: a new "自动贴边" (auto edge-snap) switch in settings, default on. On = previous behaviour (half-hide + snap to the nearest edge); off = free mode — the orb stops where you drop it, stays fully visible, never auto-collapses, and the bubble prefers the right side (flips left only when it cannot fit); the free position persists across restarts.
- **Measured bubble height**: the card page now measures its own content and reports the exact height back, eliminating the ~half-row dead strip below the session list (the old fixed formula had drifted from the rendered CSS); the "+N more sessions" line is no longer clipped.

### 0.3.0
- **Task orb, three-window architecture**: the whale disc docks half-hidden at the screen's left/right edge (circle center on the edge line, zero gap); hover slides it out and opens the session bubble (orb ↔ bubble act as one hover zone with a 350ms relay), collapsing when you leave; drag follows the pointer and snaps back to the nearest horizontal edge with a bounce on release.
- **Status at a glance**: a conic light sweeps the ring while tasks run and a count badge shows (from 1 up); an attention dot marks needs-approval (amber) / needs-answer (pink) / done-unread (white) — badge and dot flip to the visible half depending on the docked edge; the whole orb greys out when the backend is stale.
- **Left-click** raises the main window (and collapses the bubble); **right-click** opens a custom frosted-glass menu (refresh window / start backend, or restart + stop / orb settings) that closes on blur, flips near screen edges and is mutually exclusive with the bubble.
- **Bubble window**: a frosted card popping from the orb's inner side (with a tail pointing at the whale) listing every session and its status (running / needs approval / needs answer / done + unread dot); clicking a row jumps straight to that session via the documented client face (`ctx.sessions.open`), clicking blank space just raises the main window; any click collapses it; state changes pop it open once and it auto-collapses after a configurable 2–15s.
- **Settings**: the orb settings window is now a frameless rounded card with content-driven auto height; orb size (40-96px), background opacity, font size, dark/light theme and bubble auto-collapse all apply live.
- **Official icon**: the orb and the settings title bar use the project's own black-whale logo (auto-inverted to white on the dark theme).
- Breaking: `overlay.pos` became `side` + `anchorY` (0.2.x card position/width settings are not carried over).

### 0.2.1
- New caption safe-area spacer inside the shell: Electron's native window buttons (titleBarOverlay) float above the page, and the official right-aligned header utilities (「导出日志」/export log) landed underneath them. The desktop shell's client half registers an invisible spacer cell through the documented Slots face (`conversation.session.header.utilities`), shifting every header utility 148px left of the native overlay. Active only inside the shell (`window.shellAPI` present); plain-browser users are unaffected.

### 0.2.0
- **New task overlay window**: an always-on-top desktop card (GPU-monitor style) showing live DSH session status —
  - "DSH idle" when nothing works; "N sessions running" plus per-session names when active;
  - each row is badged 处理中 / 需要审批 / 需要回答 / 已完成 (Running / Needs approval / Needs answer / Done); a finished task becomes unread (white dot) until you click its row, which clears the mark and brings the main window to the front;
  - drag the header to move (position remembered; resettable from the tray), **drag the right edge to set the width** (220–640px, double-click the edge to restore the default; height always adapts to the row count), translucent frosted background with adjustable opacity (20%–100%), dark/light theme and font size (11–18px);
  - **clicking any row jumps the Web UI to that session** via the documented client command face (`ctx.sessions.open()`) and raises the main window; a 已完成 row is removed once clicked — the card only persistently shows running / needs-approval / needs-answer work;
  - approval / answer / done rows **flash twice** when they appear, so a status change is impossible to miss;
  - controls live in tray → "任务悬浮窗" submenu (show toggle / Settings… / Reset position & width); changes apply instantly.
- Built solely on the documented cordis extension surface: `agent/created` / `agent/status` / `agent/disposed` subscriptions plus transparent observers on the `approval/request` and `user-questions/request` waterfalls (outcomes forwarded untouched). The plugin half atomically writes a snapshot to `~/.dsh/desktop-shell-state.json`; the Electron shell only reads that file — no port, no token, no internal transport. Heartbeat older than 12s shows "backend offline".
- **dsh 0.1.2 launch-token support**: the shell loads the tokenized authUrl instead of the bare loopback root, fixing 401 blank pages after reload; backend restarts re-attach automatically (merged fix/dsh-0.1.2-index-token-auth).
- Forked to `lzd-loostone/dsh-clean-desktop-shell`: auto-update sources (GitHub Releases / electron-updater publish) and package metadata now point at the fork, so self-updates no longer pull from upstream.

### 0.1.11
- Fixed a `checkForUpdate` ReferenceError introduced in v0.1.10.

### 0.1.10
- Version comparison now uses semver (`semver.coerce` + `semver.gt`) — the industry standard — replacing the hand-rolled tuple parser.
- All HTTP timeouts migrated to `AbortSignal.timeout` (standard self-cleaning API, no manual controller leaks).
- Config persistence switched to atomic writes (tmp + rename); a crash mid-write can no longer truncate config.json.
- Removed the developer-machine-specific hardcoded path (`D:\deepseek-harness\prod\...`); replaced with config `backendPath` + `DSH_BACKEND_DIR` env var + npm global dir candidates.
- Windows backend stop now uses `taskkill /T /F` tree kill (the old `proc.kill()` left orphan node children holding the port when the command was a .cmd shim); POSIX falls back through SIGTERM → SIGKILL gracefully.
- Shortcut management rewritten to Electron-native `shell.writeShortcutLink` / `readShortcutLink`, dropping the PowerShell + WScript COM dependency (also fixes OneDrive Desktop redirection via `app.getPath('desktop')`).
- New process-level crash guard: `uncaughtException` / `unhandledRejection` append to `userData/shell-crash.log` (128 KB cap with auto-truncation) — attachable in bug reports.
- Electron runtime zip now verified against SHASUMS256.txt post-download (SHA-256 streaming check); corrupted files are discarded and the next mirror source is tried.
- Resilience hardening: backend stdout/stderr capped at 64 KB ring buffer; config load type-validates known keys and silently drops unknown ones; offline page detection upgraded from `includes('error.html')` to precise file:// URL comparison.
- `npm run check` syntax gate expanded from 1 file (lib/index.js) to all 17 shipped JS files.

### 0.1.9
- One-click "update now" for plugin mode when a new version is found: the
  installing package manager (pnpm/npm/yarn/bun) is inferred from the lockfile
  next to the install, and a chain of command variants (with a corepack
  fallback) absorbs PATH and pnpm version differences. The on-disk version is
  verified afterwards, with success / unchanged / failure dialogs — failures
  list the attempted commands and output (copyable).
- The update dialog also shows a copyable manual command and keeps the DSH
  market entry; commands run via `shell:true` + `windowsHide` on Windows for
  `.cmd` shim and PowerShell / cmd compatibility.

### 0.1.8
- Plugin (npm-installed) mode now checks the npm registry `dist-tags.latest`
  and compares it against the local version from the same source, instead of
  wrongly querying GitHub `/releases/latest` (when the GitHub Latest tag
  lagged behind, this produced the contradictory "current 0.1.7 is up to date
  (v0.1.6)" dialog).
- The packaged desktop app still uses GitHub Releases; dropped the redundant
  version repetition in the "up to date" dialog.

### 0.1.7
- **Fixed a silent failure that made the window never open on macOS**: the
  Electron macOS archive is an `Electron.app` bundle with the binary at
  `Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron`; the launcher was looking for a
  top-level `electron` (the Linux layout) and gave up without any feedback.
- Extraction now tries multiple strategies (ditto / unzip / tar) and verifies
  the payload; the executable bit is restored and the macOS quarantine
  attribute is cleared afterwards.
- Launch failures no longer vanish into the log: diagnostics are written to
  `desktop-shell-launch.log` and its full path is reported.
- macOS tray now uses a template image so it adapts to light/dark menu bars;
  the Windows-only "create desktop shortcut" item is hidden elsewhere.
- Added `CONTRIBUTORS.md` and an open call for Mac co-maintainers (signing,
  notarization, real-device verification).

### 0.1.6
- Fixed "check for updates" reporting the Electron runtime version in plugin mode.

### 0.1.5
- Refactored the plugin host half into focused modules.
- Completed package.json metadata (repository / homepage / bugs); dropped a stale auto-launch field.
- README: usage before install, architecture reflects the two forms, platform matrix top-level.

### 0.1.4
- Branch 2 (plugin-market distribution) is now live: `dsh plugin add` →
  restart `dsh web` → the desktop shell opens automatically. The Electron
  runtime is self-provisioned by the plugin (local reuse / network-aware
  source selection).
- Desktop shortcut: first-run prompt + one-click "create desktop shortcut"
  in the tray (both the installer and plugin forms).
- Icons: Windows taskbar and macOS Dock show the whale icon in bare-runtime
  (plugin) mode.
- Auto-launch (login item) removed — both forms are now fully manual.

### 0.1.2
- Windows auto-update: tray "check for updates" now downloads in the
  background with progress and installs on restart (electron-updater);
  macOS keeps the manual download flow.
- Launch-time backend auto-start removed (fully manual now, no longer
  fights an explicit "stop backend").
- Contributor files added (CONTRIBUTING / CoC / SECURITY / issue & PR
  templates).
- README: Windows SmartScreen install guide; clarified that "plugin
  registration ≠ installing the desktop app".

### 0.1.1
- Backend lifecycle: fixed `spawn EINVAL` / stuck "starting" on Windows;
  "stop backend" now really shuts the service down (including externally
  started instances); start/restart/stop show progress dialogs.
- Window reliability: shows instantly on double-click; flips to the offline
  screen the moment the backend stops; auto-reconnects when it comes back
  (Edge-style instant refresh).
- Offline screen self-service: reload / start backend / auto-detect backend /
  set backend install folder.
- Tray: new "reload window" item; macOS builds released (Intel + Apple
  Silicon DMG).

### 0.1.0
- Initial release: Electron shell skeleton, system tray / single instance, DSH plugin mounting.
